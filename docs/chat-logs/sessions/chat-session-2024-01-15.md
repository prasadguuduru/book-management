### 21. TypeScript Error.cause Support
**User Query**: Why ESLint not ignoring?
**Issue**: The error is from TypeScript compiler, not ESLint
**Solution**: Updated backend tsconfig.json to use ES2022
**Change**:
```diff
- "target": "ES2020"
+ "target": "ES2022"
+ "lib": ["ES2022"]
```
**Reason**: Error.cause property requires ES2022 or later



### 21. Enhancing backend logging at each and every logic and method in backend folder especially at lambda level
**User Query**: Lets try to update verbose log across each typescript backend method, such way it is easier for developing and triaging
**Issue**: enabling logging across repo and typescript functions
**Solution**: enhance logging
**Reason**: For debugging


### 22. Generate 02-ARCHITECTURE.md file and add mermaid graph of high level flow Client Layer -> CDN(cloudfront) -> API Layer -> Compute Layer and Sub Graph (Storage Layer) and Notification Service Layer (Integration Layer) and monitoring Layer
**User Query**: Generate 02-ARCHITECTURE.md file and add mermaid graph of high level flow Client Layer -> CDN(cloudfront) -> API Layer -> Compute Layer and Sub Graph (Storage Layer) and Notification Service Layer (Integration Layer) and monitoring Layer

Note: Few principles to consider Serverless First, Single Repository but micro services, clear boundaris, independent deployment, fault isolation , Event driven architecture, Zero Trust, Defence in Depth, least privilege, Encrytion Every where data protected at rest and in transit
**Issue**:  Generate 02-ARCHITECTURE.md file
**Solution**:  Generate 02-ARCHITECTURE.md file
**Reason**:  Generate 02-ARCHITECTURE.md file And cusor should strictly follow this architecure.md file for driving any decisions.



### 23. Like wise genrate  a component architecture in 02-ARCHITECTURE.md, basically api endpoints and Custom Authorizer where we do API request and JWT Token Validation
**User Query**: Like wise genrate  a component architecture, basically api endpoints and Custom Authorizer where we do API request and JWT Token Validation

Note: Sequence diagram should be some thing like this

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant APIGW as API Gateway
    participant AUTH as Custom Authorizer
    participant LAMBDA as Lambda Function
    participant DDB as DynamoDB
    
    Client->>APIGW: API Request + JWT Token
    APIGW->>AUTH: Extract & Validate Token
    AUTH->>AUTH: Verify Signature (RS256)
    AUTH->>AUTH: Check Expiration
    AUTH->>AUTH: Extract Role & Permissions
    AUTH->>APIGW: IAM Policy (Allow/Deny)
    APIGW->>LAMBDA: Forward Request + User Context
    LAMBDA->>DDB: Execute Business Logic
    DDB-->>LAMBDA: Return Data
    LAMBDA-->>APIGW: Response
    APIGW-->>Client: Final Response
```
**Issue**:  Generate 02-ARCHITECTURE.md file
**Solution**:  Generate 02-ARCHITECTURE.md file
**Reason**:  Generate 02-ARCHITECTURE.md file And cusor should strictly follow this architecure.md file for driving any decisions.


### 24.Generate  Data Architecure in Architecture.md file  in  02-ARCHITECTURE.md
**User Query**: lets finalize on how our data modal should look like, single table dynamodb design with ttl, updatedAT, createdAt, Version as mandtory parameters
**Issue**: lets finalize on how our data modal should look like, single table dynamodb design with ttl, updatedAT, createdAt, Version as mandtory parameters
**Solution**:lets finalize on how our data modal should look like, single table dynamodb design with ttl, updatedAT, createdAt, Version as mandtory parameters
**Reason**: for confirming on data architecture


### 25.Generate  Access Patterns based on problem statment in  02-ARCHITECTURE.md
**User Query**: Access Patterns, get User, get User's Books, Get Book Reviews, Get Boooks by Status, Get Books by Genred, Workflow History and User Sessions
**Issue**: Access Patterns, get User, get User's Books, Get Book Reviews, Get Boooks by Status, Get Books by Genred, Workflow History and User Sessions
**Solution**: add Access Patterns, get User, get User's Books, Get Book Reviews, Get Boooks by Status, Get Books by Genred, Workflow History and User Sessions in  02-ARCHITECTURE.md
**Reason**: for confirming on access patterns



### 26. Generate Integration patterns, API versioning strategy as per best practices in same document.
**User Query**:  Lets generate Integration patterns, API versioning strategy as per best practices in same document.
**Issue**: generate Integration patterns, API versioning strategy
**Solution**: add generate Integration patterns, API versioning strategy in  02-ARCHITECTURE.md
**Reason**: for confirming on generate Integration patterns, API versioning strategy
