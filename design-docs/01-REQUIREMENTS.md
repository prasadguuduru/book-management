## Technical Requirements

### **Architecture Constraints**

#### **Serverless-First Approach**

- **Primary Platform**: AWS Serverless stack
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda (Node.js 18.x)
- **API**: API Gateway (REST + WebSocket)
- **Database**: DynamoDB with single-table design
- **Storage**: S3 for file assets
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform

#### **Development Standards**

- **Language**: TypeScript for both frontend and backend
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with hooks
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline docs + external guides

### **Database Design**

#### **DynamoDB Single Table Pattern**

```typescript
interface TableStructure {
  PK: string; // Partition Key
  SK: string; // Sort Key
  GSI1PK?: string; // Global Secondary Index 1
  GSI1SK?: string;
  entityType: string; // USER | BOOK | REVIEW | WORKFLOW
  data: any; // Entity-specific data
  createdAt: string; // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string; // ISO timestamp
  version: number; // Optimistic concurrency
}
```

#### **Access Patterns**

1. Get user by ID: `PK=USER#{userId}`, `SK=PROFILE`
2. Get user's books: `PK=USER#{userId}`, `SK begins with BOOK#`
3. Get book details: `PK=BOOK#{bookId}`, `SK=METADATA`
4. Get book reviews: `PK=BOOK#{bookId}`, `SK begins with REVIEW#`
5. Get books by status: `GSI1PK=STATUS#{status}`, `GSI1SK=BOOK#{bookId}`
6. Get workflow history: `PK=WORKFLOW#{bookId}`, `SK=timestamp`

### **API Design Principles**

#### **RESTful API Standards**

- **Base URL**: `https://api.ebook-platform.com/v1`
- **Authentication**: Bearer JWT tokens
- **Content Type**: `application/json`
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Semantic usage (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- **Rate Limiting**: 1000 requests/minute per user
- **Versioning**: URL path versioning (`/v1/`, `/v2/`)

#### **Error Response Format**

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
    timestamp: string;
    requestId: string;
  };
}
```

---

## Security Requirements

### **Authentication & Authorization**

#### **JWT Token Specification**

- **Algorithm**: RS256 (asymmetric)
- **Access Token Expiry**: 15 minutes
- **Refresh Token Expiry**: 7 days
- **Required Claims**: `sub`, `role`, `permissions`, `iat`, `exp`, `aud`, `iss`
- **Token Rotation**: Automatic refresh token rotation on use

#### **RBAC Implementation**

```typescript
interface Permission {
  resource: string; // books, reviews, users
  action: string; // create, read, update, delete
  condition?: string; // ownership, state-based
}

interface Role {
  name: 'AUTHOR' | 'EDITOR' | 'PUBLISHER' | 'READER';
  permissions: Permission[];
}
```

### **Data Protection**

#### **Encryption Standards**

- **At Rest**: DynamoDB encryption with AWS managed KMS keys
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Application Level**: AES-256-GCM for PII data
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS with automatic rotation

#### **Data Classification**

- **Public**: Published book content, public reviews
- **Internal**: User profiles, reading preferences
- **Confidential**: Draft content, editorial feedback
- **Restricted**: Authentication credentials, audit logs

### **Security Controls**

#### **Input Validation**

- **Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized against XSS
- **Validation**: Schema-based validation with Joi
- **Rate Limiting**: API Gateway throttling + application-level limits
- **File Upload**: Type validation, size limits, virus scanning

#### **Monitoring & Alerting**

- **Security Events**: Failed logins, privilege escalations, data breaches
- **Thresholds**: >5 failed logins = account lock, >100 API calls/minute = rate limit
- **Response**: Automated blocking, security team alerts, audit logging
